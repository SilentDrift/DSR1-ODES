The integrating factor is $\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\,dx} = e^{4x}$. Multiplying the ODE by $\mu(x)$ gives $\frac{d}{dx}[e^{4x}y] = e^{4x}\cdot 0$, since the left side becomes the derivative of $e^{4x}y$. Integrating both sides with respect to $x$ yields: $e^{4x}y = \int e^{4x}\cdot 0\,dx + C = C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 2$: we have $e^{4\cdot 0} \cdot 2 = C$. Thus, $C = 2$. Substituting $C$ back in, the solution is $y = \frac{C}{e^{4x}} = \frac{2}{e^{4x}}$.<|end▁of▁sentence|>"

The integrating factor is $\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\,dx} = e^{x}$. Multiplying the ODE by $\mu(x)$ gives $\frac{d}{dx}[e^{x}y] = e^{x}\cos(x)$, since the left side becomes the derivative of $e^{x}y$.

Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 1$: we have $e^{0}\cdot 1 = \frac{e^{0}(\sin(0) + \cos(0))}{2} + C$, so $1 = \frac{1(0 + 1)}{2} + C$, thus $C = \frac{1}{2}$.

Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 5$ to solve for $C$: plugging in, $\ln|5| = -2\cdot 0 + C$, so $C = \ln(5)$. Thus, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is given by $\ln|y| = -2x + \ln(5)$. Solving for $y$ gives the particular solution: $y = 5e^{-2x}$.<|end▁of▁sentence|>"

Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 20$ to solve for $C$: plugging in, $\ln|20 - 5| = -0 + C$, so $C = \ln(15)$. Thus, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is given by $\ln|y - 5| = -x + \ln(15)$.

We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}\, dy = x\, dx$. Integrating both sides, we get: $2\sqrt{y} = \frac{x^2}{2} + C$. Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 1$: $2\sqrt{1} = \frac{0^2}{2} + C$, so $C = 2$. Thus, the implicit relationship is $2\sqrt{y} = \frac{x^2}{2} + 2$. Solving for $y$ gives $\sqrt{y} = \frac{x^2 + 4}{4}$, so $y = \left(\frac{x^2 + 4}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{(x^2 + 4)^2}{16}$.<|end▁of▁sentence|>"

Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 1$: plugging in, $\frac{1^2}{2} = \frac{0^3}{3} + C$, so $C = \frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the implicit relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $\frac{y^2}{2} = \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{1}{2}$. Solving for $y$ gives $y^2 = \frac{2x^3}{3} + 1$, so $y = \sqrt{\frac{2x^3}{3} + 1}$ (taking the positive branch since $y(0)=1 > 0$).<|end▁of▁sentence|>"

We can rewrite it as $e^{-y}\, dy = x\, dx$. Integrating both sides gives: $-e^{-y} = \frac{x^2}{2} + C$. Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 0$ to solve for $C$: plugging in, $-e^{-0} = \frac{0^2}{2} + C$, so $-1 = 0 + C$, thus $C = -1$. Thus, the implicit relationship is $-e^{-y} = \frac{x^2}{2} - 1$. Solving for $y$ gives $e^{-y} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}$, so $y = -\ln\!\Big(1 - \frac{x^2}{2}\Big)$, valid as long as $1 - \frac{x^2}{2} > 0$.<|end▁of▁sentence|>"

Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 3$ to solve for $C$: plugging in, $\frac{1}{4}\ln\Big|\frac{3 - 2}{3 + 2}\Big| = 0 + C$, so $C = \frac{1}{4}\ln\!\frac{1}{5}$.
